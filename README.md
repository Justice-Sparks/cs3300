# This was an Ubuntu based website 
# I built this for my Intro to Software Development Class 
# This was my first time doing web development 

For the back end: 
I used a Docker container leveraging Ubuntu as a hosting base.  
I was using Running Ruby on Rails 
Ruby was the language 
Rails was the software scaffolding service
I used RSPEC for integrated testing
I used port forwarding for my test server 
I used Heroku cloud services for the live cloud server 
I used circleCI for continuous integration 
As well as GitHub for version control 

On the front end: 
I used HTML And CSS for the aesthetic
I used the bootstrap gem for the buttons on the website
And I used the Devise gem from the Ruby library to force user authentication. 

The website was fully functional: 
It allowed users to sign in, Create, read, edit and delete files, as well as signing out and handling multiple users. 
I was not pleased with the website’s aesthetic in the end, but it was a good learning experience and it met all the requirements for the class. 

You can find all the documentation for this on my Github, 
But unfortunately the The Heroku-18 stack that was used for cloud deployment has become deprecated since that was a couple of semesters ago. 
I could update the stack on my heroku profile but then I would need to redeploy the app from the docker container. That specific docker container was created using a virtual box on my last computer, which I have since traded in for a newer model, so it would be quite a bit of reconfiguring to recover the website and I just haven’t found the time to do that with all the classes I’ve been taking since then.
